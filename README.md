TODOS:
- excalidraw
  - find a CLI version?
  - `.excalidraw` -> `.dark.svg` and `.light.svg` (and `.png` probably too)
- [Manim slides](https://manim-slides.eertmans.be/latest/)
- Reveal.js support
- as an alternative (or in addition) to Reveal.js support, what about a feature where between every paragraph, youo can click a button that expands a drawing region? and just generally being able to annotate the page?
- print outs
  - LaTeX?
  - pollen target for an 8.5" x 11" HTML version of the webpage, and then print that out?
  - holy shit! [you can define a CSS class that hides elements when printing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55169528)
